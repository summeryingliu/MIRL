Description: Implements a variable selection and prediction method for high-dimensional data with missing entries following the paper Liu et al. (2016) <doi:10.1214/15-AOAS899>. It deals with missingness by multiple imputation and produces a selection probability for each variable following stability selection. The user can further choose a threshold for the selection probability to select a final set of variables. The threshold can be picked by cross validation or the user can define a practical threshold for selection probability.
